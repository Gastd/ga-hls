# Diagnosis

## Overview
This repository complements the paper _Search-based Trace Diagnostic_.
The content of this repository is divided as follows:

- `experiments_results`: Results of the experiments presented on the paper. Includes the output files, decision tree models and a png picture of the tool result. Experiments are separated by folder.
- `results_analysis`: Python scripts used to measure precision and recall for each experiment. Scripts for plotting the boxplot also included.
- `tool`: Tool implementation as used in the paper. The inside readme shows how to run each experiment. Also, it includes the HLS specification for each requirement shown in the paper.
- `Appendix.pdf`: Paper Appendix with the result comparison between _Tool_ and _Prediction_. Also available in [here](https://zenodo.org/records/12520835).
