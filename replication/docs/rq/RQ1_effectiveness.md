# RQ1 — Effectiveness (expert alignment)

This page documents:
- which experiments were used (Exp1–Exp34)
- how precision/recall were computed from tool-vs-expert DT agreement
- where to find the per-experiment artifacts

## Artifacts
- Per-experiment DTs: `results/trees/exp*/`
- Summary metrics: `results/summary/precision_recall.csv`

## Metric computation (as in paper)
- Candidate mutated requirements are generated by discretizing numeric ranges into a uniform grid (101 values per numeric token).
- Discrete tokens (e.g., logical operators) are fully enumerated.
- Undecided is treated as inconclusive and excluded from TP/TN/FP/FN counts.
